# Tabular Data Gym, Episode 1

Here we deal with 10 most voted (annoying) questions about pandas on StackOverflow. 

### Data Gym Rules:

1. Fork and clone repo
2. Create a directory with your name, let's assume the name is Carlos.
3. Inside this directory (Carlos) create three directories Iteration1, Iteration2, Iteration3 
   and copy the content of code_template to each of them (so your are going to have three copies).
4. Start from directory Iteration1 and try solve the problem(s) (recommended time for it is 25 minutes).
5. The take a brake and think what you did well and what you could improve.
6. Repeat steps 4. 5. in directories Iteration2 and Iteration3. If you wish, you can create more 
   Iterations directories and repeat as many times as you want.
7. Push changes to the fork and do Pull Request.
8. We will add your name to Hall of Fame List then.
