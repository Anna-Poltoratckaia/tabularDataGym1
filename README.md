# Tabular Data Gym, Episode 1

Here we deal with 10 most voted (annoying) questions about pandas on
StackOverflow. Try to solve them.  Then, if you want, you can try to solve
them using `R` packages like `data.table`, `dplyr` or just `data.frame`.
If you do it, please add a file, for example,
`data.table_pandas_10.ipynb`. You can also try to solve them using `pandasql`
package.`

### Data Gym Rules:

1. Fork and clone repo
2. Create a directory with your name.
3. Inside this directory (with your name) create three directories
   `Iteration1`, `Iteration2`, `Iteration3` and copy the content of
   `code_template` to each of them (so your are going to have three
   copies).
4. Start from directory `name/Iteration1` and try solve the problem(s)
   (recommended time for it is 25 minutes).
5. The take a break and think what you have done well and what you could
   improve.
6. Repeat steps 4. 5. in directories `name/Iteration2` and
   `name/Iteration3`. If you wish to repeat more time, you can create
   more Iterations directories.
7. Push changes to the fork and do Pull Request.
8. We will add your name to Hall of Fame List then.


### Recommended software

1. `R` packages: `data.table`, `dplyr`, `ggplot2`
2. `python3` packages: `jupyter`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `r2py`, `pandasql`
